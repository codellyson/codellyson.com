description: A guide to creating and applying production hotfixes in Git without disrupting the Git workflow.
---


This guide outlines the process for creating and applying a hotfix to your production environment while maintaining the integrity of your Git workflow.

## Steps to Create a Production Hotfix

1. **Create a hotfix branch from the production branch**

   ```bash

   git checkout production
   git checkout -b hotfix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make necessary changes and commit**

   ```bash

   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Description of the hotfix"
   ```

3. **Push the hotfix branch and create a pull request**

   - Push the branch to the remote repository
   - Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into the production branch

4. **After approval, merge the hotfix into production**

   ```bash

   git checkout production
   git merge hotfix/issue-description
   git push origin production
   ```

5. **Tag the new production version (Optional)**

   ```bash

   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix release v1.0.1"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

6. **Merge the hotfix into the main development branch**

   ```bash

   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/issue-description
   git push origin develop
   ```

7. **Delete the hotfix branch**
   ```bash

   git branch -d hotfix/issue-description
   git push origin --delete hotfix/issue-description
   ```

## Best Practices

- Only use hotfixes for critical bugs that must be immediately addressed in production.
- Keep hotfixes small and focused on the specific issue.
- Ensure thorough testing of the hotfix before merging into production.
- Always update both production and development branches with the hotfix.
- Communicate the hotfix to the development team to ensure everyone is aware of the changes.

By following this process, you can quickly address production issues while maintaining a clean and organized Git history.
